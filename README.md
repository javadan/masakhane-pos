First data science competition, https://zindi.africa/competitions/lacuna-masakhane-parts-of-speech-classification-challenge
12th of 88

The task was cross-lingual transfer using BERT.  
Got a transformer-adapter version working too.  This solution was pretty basic, just trial and error with pre-training on corpora, and cross training on languages most similar to the target languages, Luo and Setswana.  

The key to the competition turned out to be pseudo-labelling.
